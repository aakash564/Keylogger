A keylogger is a type of spyware that can be installed on a computer, phone, or tablet to monitor and record keystrokes and touches. Here are the key points:

Function: When active, a keylogger records everything you type, including passwords, account information, emails, and website searches.
Additional Features: Some keyloggers can also capture mouse movements, screen images, and clicked website links.
Invasiveness: Keyloggers are highly invasive because they silently track and log all user input.
Types: There are two main types:
Software Keyloggers: These are installed invisibly on the device to be monitored. They often accompany other malware and can automatically send logs over the network or via email.
Hardware Keyloggers: These physical devices need to be physically attached to the computer (usually between the keyboard and the computer). They use onboard storage and require manual retrieval.
